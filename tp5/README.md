## TP 5 Notes

### Exercises
- The teapot related exercises were fairly simple, it mostly consisted of looking and grabbing code from the shaders already provided and making small changes to them.
- To soften the variations in height of the water texture, a box blur algorithm was used. It didn't have much of an effect in the end, but it was a fun exercise to implement. For the variations in color, the color in the *waterMap* texture was inverted and mixed with the color of the *waterTex* texture in a 30/70 proportion, respectively.
