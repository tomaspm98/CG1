### Point 1
- Initially we were having a little bit of trouble to draw the sphere, but then we realised that to draw it we would need a implementaion similar to the used to draw the cylinder.
- So, we reused that code and made some modifications and it was pretty inutitve doing like that.
- To apply the texture we found it very easy and was similar to what we did in TP classes.
