## TP 2 Notes

### Exercise 1
- The tangram part exercise turned out to be relatively straightforward after figuring out how to properly make use of the transformation functions.
- Keeping in mind that transformations must be written in reverse order can be difficult, but there's an easy work around: write the first transformation and then write each following transformation in the line directly above the previous.
- Checking the "CFG.js" file in the lib folder revealed that the class *CFGobject* keeps a reference to the scene it's created in, which facilitated the implementation of the *MyTangram* class.

### Exercise 2
- TODO

### Exercise 3
-
